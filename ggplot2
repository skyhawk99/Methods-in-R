# USEFUL FUNCTIONS IN THE GGPLOT2 LIBRARY

# Load library 
# (ggplot2 package is included in tidyverse)
library(tidyverse)

# Load data
# (Using the pre-installed mpg dataset)
data <- data.frame(mpg)

# Plotting highway efficiency (hwy) against engine size (displ) in base R
# (NOT using ggplot2)
plot(mpg$displ, mpg$hwy)
# The plot above functions correctly, but is rather bland and changing plot features
# is complex

# This is where ggplot2 comes in 

# ggplot2 syntax for the plot above

# 1. ggplot() call sets up the coordinate system
ggplot(data = mpg) + # Creates a blank canvas
# 2. geom_point() adds a layer of points to the plot 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
# There are many geom_xxxx functions and each one requires a mapping which 
# map to a visual element in the plot 
# In the plot above the x-axis property is mapped to displ and the y-axis
# property is mapped to hwy 

# ggplot2 provides a more aesthetically pleasing plot immediately 

# Sample ggplot2 template 
# (Minimum required for a ggplot)
# ggplot(data = {data_set}) + 
  # geom_xxxx({mapping} = aes({mapping_details}))
